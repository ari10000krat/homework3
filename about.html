        <h2>Coronavirus disease 2019</h2>

        <p>
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since
            spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss
            of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Around one in five
            infected individuals do not develop any symptoms. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop
            acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms multi-organ failure,
            septic shock, and blood clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been
            observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of
            the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards. These
            effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low-grade fever, muscle weakness,
            and breathlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another
            person. Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and mouth
            as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into their
            mouth, nose or eyes. The virus may also spread via contaminated surfaces, although this is not thought to be
            the main route of transmission. The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively, but infection
            mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough. It can spread as early as two days before
            infected persons show symptoms, and from individuals who never experience symptoms. People remain infectious
            for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. Various testing methods have been
            developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription
            polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,
            covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face
            masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions. Several
            vaccines have been developed and various countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.
        </p>

        <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            COVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs,
            sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an
            infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people
            who are in close contact with the infected person. During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000
            infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19.
            Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer
            distances only involve aerosols. The larger droplets may also evaporate into the aerosols (known as droplet
            nuclei). The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020,
            however the virus is not known to transmit between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts.
            Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations, such as in restaurants,
            choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when they are crowded or less ventilated. It
            also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on
            COVID-19 patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social distancing and the wearing of cloth face masks, surgical masks, respirators, or other face coverings
            are controls for droplet transmission. Transmission may be decreased indoors with well maintained heating
            and ventilation systems to maintain good air circulation and increase the use of outdoor air.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated
            that one infected person will, on average, infect between two and three other people. This is more
            infectious than influenza, but less so than measles. It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be
            traced back to an index case or geographical location. There is a major role of "super-spreading events",
            where many people are infected by one person.
